# CatchTheDrop
CatchTheDrop is a little single/two-players Kinect based videogame. The goal is to catch as fast as possible the falling drops. It's developed in C# / WPF. It has been realized as a case-study for a demo event organized by Beps Engineering, based on one of the Kinect SDK sample application.
